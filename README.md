# Speech-Evaluator
A tool that uses ollama and whisper to evaluate speeches

*IMPORTANT: INSTALL OLLAMA, WHISPER, and PYTHON BEFORE USING**

Ollama: https://ollama.com/

Whisper: https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#setup  (Should just be running ``` pip install -U openai-whisper``` in a terminal window

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing python
Open a command line winodw or terminal and run the following command
```
pip install ollama
```

To run, navigate to the folder with the file main.py and enter
```
python main.py
```

I personally suggest audacity to record the speech
